# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
						
## Description
My family and I are planning our annual winter trip abroad. We have several cities in mind but would like a convenient way to check the weather forecast for said cities. I decided to build out a weather dashboard that takes an input for city. From there it will show current day and five future days with all relevant weather info. I thought it would be fun to add an icon with the weather display. I accomplished this by using HTML, CSS for the interface and JavaScript with DOM manipulation for the logic.
