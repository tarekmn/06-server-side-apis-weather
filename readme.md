# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
						
## Description
My co-worker and I were talking about how busy we've been lately. We thought it would be a great idea to build out a daily planner. This planner would be color quoted for past hours (gray), present hours(red) and future hours(green). We wanted the planner to save text regardless of refreshing the page. I accomplished this by using HTML, CSS for the interface and JavaScript with JQuery DOM manipulation for the logic.
